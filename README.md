# Javi Food
Javi food is a food order platform... that's it.

This project is only for study purposes (since I haven't gotten a good project idea to sell yet ðŸ¥º), the main idea is to create a few microsservices and connect then following the EDA pattern.

The FrontEnd part will not be implemented.


What I want to review/learn from here:

- Microsservices architecture
- Message Queues
- Golang
- Architectural docs (C4, maybe archimate)
- Databases
  - SQL and NoSQL databases
- Event Sourcing (maybe)
- Architectural patterns
- Mermaid (Last DaaC I used was PlantUML - Gotta say that for the C4 model, PlantUML is better, mermaid is too messy, at least so far)
- Stress/Load testing
- K8s
- SonarQube

# Documentation
